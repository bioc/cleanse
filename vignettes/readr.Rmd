## 
Due to their unique ability to contain row- and colData, SummarizedExperiments (se's) 
can not be written to a delimited file using functions such as write_csv. 
A set of functions is provided to mimic the write_<format> functions of readr.
To write the example `seq_se` to a file, use
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(SummarizedExperiment)
library(cleanse)
write_se_to_csv(seq_se, "expression", "out.csv")
```
